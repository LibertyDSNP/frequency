## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design considerations and specifications for integrating P256 Passkey support into our system. Passkey support aims to provide users with a secure and convenient way to manage their tokens while ensuring the integrity and privacy of their cryptographic keys.

## 2. Terminology

- **Passkey**: A cryptographic key generated and managed by the user to sign transactions and access their account.
- **Seed Phrase**: A mnemonic phrase used to generate cryptographic keys, particularly for SR25519 accounts.
- **Authorized Account**: The user account associated with the Passkey.
- **Parent Account**: The account holding the primary private key for transaction signing.
- **Frequency Access**: The platform facilitating the management and interaction with user accounts.

## 4. Data Map for Legal Teams

(Provide a data map detailing what information is stored, where it's stored, and its legal implications.)

## 5. Specification

### Passkey Registration

(Describe the process of Passkey registration, including user interactions, key generation, and backend storage.)

### Security Considerations

(Outline the security measures to be implemented both on the client-side and server-side to ensure the safety of user data and transactions.)

### Transaction Submission Specification

(Provide a detailed specification for forming and submitting transactions on-chain, including inputs, hashes, signature data, and necessary extensions.)

## 6. Implementation

### Backend Example Code

(Include code snippets demonstrating how to implement Passkey support on the backend.)

### Frontend Example Code

(Include code snippets demonstrating how to implement Passkey support on the frontend.)

## 7. Options for Discussion

### Unsigned Extensions vs MultiSignature

(Discuss the pros and cons of using unsigned extensions versus multisignature schemes for transaction verification.)

### Generic Key Support

(Consider whether to support keys from wallets other than those generated by Passkey.)

### Separate Pallet

(Discuss the feasibility and benefits of implementing Passkey support as a separate pallet within the system.)

## 8. Conclusion

(Summarize the key points of the design document and outline next steps for implementation and further discussion.)
